## About the Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode playground! This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in C++. I strive to provide not only correct solutions but also detailed explanations for the approach and thought process behind each solution.

Solving LeetCode problems is not just about finding the right answer; it's about honing problem-solving skills, learning new algorithms, and thinking creatively. I hope my solutions can help and inspire fellow programmers in their coding journey.

## Getting Started

To access a solution, simply navigate to the corresponding problem's folder. Each folder is named after the problem's title. Inside the folder, you'll find a well-documented C++ solution along with any necessary explanations.

Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback. If you have a better approach or want to discuss a solution, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request!

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! If you've found a more optimized solution, want to add new problems, or simply want to improve the explanations, your contributions are highly appreciated.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-new-solution`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -am 'Add a new solution for Problem XYZ'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-new-solution`.
5. Open a pull request and let's discuss the changes!

## Contact
